    My web hosting was set to renew in March 2025 and I decided that it was best to
    transfer over to free hosting as I hadn't done really anything with my blog in
    the past year.  I do still plan to get into writing blogs, but for now I don't
    think it's worth much monetary investment.

    I've transferred a few of my favorite posts from wordpress - any future ones
    will be net new.
