Hey, I’m Jon – I’ve been in the tech world as a hobbyist since 2006 and
as a professional since 2014, with a focus on web applications. In my 
day-to-day life, I frequently come across information/tips that help me 
to either accomplish my goals or just make my life easier and I’d love 
to share them with you!
