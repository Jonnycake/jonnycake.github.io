### Background

This was my first, and longest, project.  The initial goal was to make a social
media platform, but it ended up just turning into a CMS and pseudo-framework.
For a while this was what powered my personal website.

### Features

While the code isn't great and the actual design for both of the themes was
terrible, it did have some decent features:

- **Automated Installation** - Generated a config file with required fields and
  created required database tables
- **Themes** - Allowed for the design of the site to be swapped out while
  keeping actual content
- **Mods** - Allowed for custom functionality to be plugged in as necessary
- **Admin Panel** - The required feature for any CMS
    - **Template / File Editor** - This was primarily where you changed the 
      actual site content
    - **Environment Tests** - Checked for required files, directories, tables,
      and permissions
    - **Debug Mode** - Displayed log messages for the duration of your session
      or until toggled off
    - **Database Editor** - Think "phpMyAdmin", but simpler
    - **IP Blocking** - Self explanatory, block users based on IP address

### Final Thoughts

The whole thing is kind of rough to look back on, but for where I was at the
time, it was great.  Also, it contributed to me getting my first job so it
couldn't have been too bad.  I still laugh thinking about walking into my first
interview with a binder full of printed out code - before knowing anything
about version control - and talking through each piece as the manager flipped
through the pages.
