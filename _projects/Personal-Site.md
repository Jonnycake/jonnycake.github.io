### Background

This site serves as a creative outlet and a place to document my technical
journeys, projects, and personal interests.  It's gone through a few iterations -
most using WordPress, but going back further it was custom code (e.g.
[SimpleSite](/projects/simplesite.html)) and now Jekyll.


### Why GitHub Pages / Jekyll?

A year or two ago, I came to the conclusion that paying for hosting on a site
that I didn't update much was kind of a waste.  At the same time, I'd had a site
since I was around 12 and wanted to keep that streak going.

Enter GitHub Pages: free hosting that allows the use of a custom domain name.
The only drawback is that you can't do anything server-side, but, for right now,
that's fine.


### Design

Visual design is one of my biggest weaknesses, but I tried to lean heavily into
it here.  The core aspects I wanted:

- Minimal
- Responsive
- Accessible
- Modern, with a retro / cyberpunk feel

I think the mono-space text on a dark background captures the idea pretty well.
I also tried to keep it mostly text-based rather than iconography / imagery to
satisfy the minimalism.

For the font, originally I was using courier, but it felt too classic.  I opted
for using [CommitMono](https://commitmono.com/) since that's what I use in my
terminal.

The hardest decision, though, was the color-scheme.  Typically I'll use either
full grayscale or black as the main color, paired with reds or greens. Instead
I decided to take inspiration from a close friend and use purple - his favorite
color - as an accent.  I think it came out really well.

I also found that using opacity changes for hover effects on links/buttons
worked out nicely.


### Development

Aside from the visual design, I also wanted to keep the payload as small and
simple as possible.  I allowed myself to use jQuery and font-awesome for the
rare icons I included, but other than that, I wanted to build out styles and
functionality by hand to avoid bloat.


### Final Thoughts

Overall, this has been a successful experience thus far and I'm happy with how
it's coming out.  I do have to go back and make some tweaks for code style
(designing via code has made the css a bit messy) and accessibiity, but I don't
expect any major changes.
